00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.850
What I want to do in this video is
give you a real short introduction in

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.120
how to use the Python Playground.

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.170
Now, we really, really indeed want you to
install Python and run it on your desktop.

4
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.970
And we give you instructions on how to
do that and videos on how to do that.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.920
The idea is eventually,
especially if you're going to complete

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.260
the entire specialization, you must run
the programs on a desktop or laptop or

7
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.670
a real computer where you can have files
and manipulate data and create databases.

8
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.350
But it's not essential in the first two
courses to actually install Python.

9
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.840
We provide you a web-based,
browser-based Python environment.

10
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.320
But again, before I show you that,
I just want to encourage you to go through

11
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.450
the installing process, and get it there,
and it's just gonna save you some time.

12
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.580
In Week 2, we have this link.

13
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.920
This link will become useful to you.

14
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.170
We call it the Python Playground,
how to develop Python in the browser.

15
00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.220
And this uses a actual Python compiler
that compiles code to JavaScript and

16
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.190
then runs it in your browser, so
we're actually not running your code.

17
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.660
We're really emulating your code.

18
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:14.080
And this Python environment that we have
is not a perfect Python environment,

19
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.370
and that's why I really want
you to use the real one.

20
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.670
It's really designed as an autograder
for the very simple Python applications

21
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.530
that I assign you in this course.
But you can play.

22
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.900
So some of these buttons you're not going
to see because you're not the teacher.

23
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.330
You'll see the Run Python button and
the Reset Code button and the Exit button.

24
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.530
So this remembers the code
that you wrote the first time.

25
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.640
And depending on what
assignment you're working on,

26
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.650
there is base code that's
not always correct.

27
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.300
In this case, I can reset the code
to the original that you will see

28
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.700
in the Python Playground, and this is it.

29
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.949
And it opens a file, and you're very at
the beginning, so don't worry about this.

30
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.690
But there are some files,
the files I use throughout the book, and

31
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.330
they're sitting here
available to be opened.

32
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.300
You can't just open any old file,
just these three files are available.

33
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.990
And then, you hit the
button and Run Python, and

34
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.150
then it runs the Python program, and the
output of the Python program happens here.

35
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.080
Now, I'll just show you, we'll just edit
this stuff and make it a little simpler.

36
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.010
Print "hello world", of course the first
thing, "hello world", and then I'll run it.

37
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.530
So this is an editing area and
this runs it.

38
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:32.150
And then,
print "have fun in the class", okay?

39
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.870
I can even make a mistake,
print make a mistake,

40
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.570
and I hit Run Python, and it won't run.

41
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.780
And, it's not the best of
error messages, but

42
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.040
it does say that there was
a problem on line three.

43
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.145
And I look, and lo and
behold, there's line three.

44
00:02:50.145 --> 00:02:55.960
And once you run it,
it actually stores the code.

45
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.460
So I'm going to finish here, get out,

46
00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.600
and then go back.

47
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.900
I mean, I'll just go right back to it.

48
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.070
And you'll see that the code I had
from before was already there.

49
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.980
And so you can use this.
The Playground is not graded.

50
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.910
And you can write any
Python code you want.

51
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.580
And a lot of people do write code.

52
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.420
We can take a look, the teaching
staff, if we find you in a forum or

53
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.590
something, we can actually
look at your code.

54
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.170
And so, you can use this as a way to
communicate with the teaching staff, okay?

55
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.820
So, I hope you find that useful.

56
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.730
The Python Playground,
you can always find that under

57
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.440
Week 2 where I have the Python,
how to run Python.

58
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.410
And it's there at this first thing.

59
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.420
So hope that's helpful to you.

60
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.380
See you on the net.

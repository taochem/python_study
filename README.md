# A note about Specializations…

A Coursera Specialization is a series of courses that are designed to build on each other and culminate in a Capstone project. To receive a Specialization certificate, you must pay for and earn a verified certificate in each of the courses. The Capstone is only open to students who have completed and received certificates in all of the other courses.

The University of Michigan offers the specializations Python for Everybody and Web Design for Everybody. Python for Everybody is based on the free textbook Python for Informatics, and includes the following courses:

- Getting Started with Python Chapters 1-5
- Python Data Structures – Chapters 6-10
- Using Python to Access Web Data – Chapters 11-13
- Using Databases with Python – Chapters 14-15
Students with a Verified Certificate in the 10-week course Programming for Everybody (PR4E) start at the third course if they want to complete the specialization.

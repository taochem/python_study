# Python Data Structure Syllabus

这部分讲述的主要是Python中的几种数据结构, 字符串string, 文件Files, 数组list, 字典dirctionary, 元组tuple. 在知道Python基本语法，比如选择判断 if else、循环 for i in range(10)之后，再有效学习这几种数据结构，就可以帮助你处理基本上所有常见的问题。比如如果你要提取一个文件中的重要信息，可以先读取文件到一个长字符串中，再通过字符串的类方法（内置函数）提取最重要的信息，然后把信息存到一个数组里面，之后可以再进行后续操作，比如画图或者输出成为文件等等。基本上学习好数据结构这一部分，就可以用Python处理常见的问题了。

# A note about Specializations…

A Coursera Specialization is a series of courses that are designed to build on each other and culminate in a Capstone project. To receive a Specialization certificate, you must pay for and earn a verified certificate in each of the courses. The Capstone is only open to students who have completed and received certificates in all of the other courses.

The University of Michigan offers the specializations Python for Everybody and Web Design for Everybody. Python for Everybody is based on the free textbook Python for Informatics, and includes the following courses:

- Getting Started with Python Chapters 1-5
- Python Data Structures – Chapters 6-10
- Using Python to Access Web Data – Chapters 11-13
- Using Databases with Python – Chapters 14-15
Students with a Verified Certificate in the 10-week course Programming for Everybody (PR4E) start at the third course if they want to complete the specialization.
